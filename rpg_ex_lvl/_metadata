  "description" : "Okay I lied, they're not endless, but 4630 it's a number you probably won't reach without commands.\n\n[h1]Q/A[/h1]\n[b]Now what then?[/b]\n-Go out!, level up!, and become a demigod. Heck keep going even [b]further [b] BEYOND![/b][/b]\n\n[b]How about other beings like Shaggy?[/b]\n-Remember that guy? No you don't, make him remember you!\n\n[b]How about his mentor, Chuck?[/b]\n-Why do you think experience points are so powerful? Experience comes from him!\n\n[b]I'll need big guns[/b]\n-See that giant gun you can't use because of low energy?, NOW YOU CAN!\n\n[b]What if a meteor hits me?[/b]\n-Max armor? HOW ABOUT MAXIMUMER ARMOR? 100% IT?S NOT ENOUGH!\n\n\n[h2]What it does:[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Allows you to reach up to level 4630.\n[*]This number was chosen because it's based on the limit of experience points, which is 2,143,690,000.\n[*]Also allows you to put more than 50 points per skill, up to and over 100,000.\n[*]The more you level up, the more skill points you get.\n[*]Allows conversion of mastery points to a max of 214,300. But be careful, all experience over \"Level limit\" wil be consumed!\n[*]Includes a slider to limit the max level, because i don't think skills were balanced to be above 50. \n(Doesn't affect already allocated points if lowered)\n[*]Adds buttons to de-allocate statpoints. And a text box to put/remove them quicker.\n[*]The textbox supports commands:[list]\n[*]\"all\" : Allocate max points.\n[*]\"distribute\":Aallocate points equally to all stats. (equals 1/7)\n[*]\"#/#\": Allows fractions to allocate points, like 1/4 to allocate 25% of your current free points.\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\n[b]Notes:[/b]\nThis is not meant to be balanced, at all.\nI made this mod for myself, but thought others might want to be OP.\nShould be compatible with other RPGGrowth mods. probably\n\nDo you want even MORE??
